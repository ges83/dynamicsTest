dynamicsTest
============

This was a test I made, while toying with UI Dynamics.

Not using anything special, just the methods used by UIDynamics.

Usage
-----

For iPhone, you can rotate the device/simulator to see how they "boxes" are affected by gravity.

For iPad, aside of the iPhone functionality, you can control gravity by buttons.

Requirements
------------
* iOS 7 or higher
* ARC
